    # NOTE: Each code line in PHP is separated with ';'
    # 1. To display something on the web page, PHP use 'echo'
    # 2. For strings PHP uses ' or "
    # 3. We can use HTML elements in PHP strings
    # 4. Control characters do not work with ', but they work with " only when the code is excecuted from the terminal though; from the browser they do not work
    # 5. To concatenate strings in PHP we use '.'
